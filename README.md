# Bike-Sharing-Case-Study-Linear-Regression-

## Problem Statement:

  A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## Business Goal:

  To create a machine learning model using available independent varibles to understand how different variables affect the scenario and also to undersand the demand dynamics of the new market. This model can be further used to manipulate business strategies to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
